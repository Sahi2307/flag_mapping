An interactive web application that allows users to **map any pattern onto a flag image** realistically by warping, blending, and shading. Powered by **Streamlit**, **OpenCV**, and **NumPy**, this app gives users a smooth, browser-based image processing experience.


## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ Warp a pattern image onto the folds of a flag  
‚úÖ Preserve realistic deformation using image gradients  
‚úÖ Smooth alpha blending with opacity control  
‚úÖ Interactive drag-and-drop image upload  
‚úÖ Built using only open-source Python libraries

## üé¨ Demo

Launch the app locally:

```bash
streamlit run script.py
````

Once running, visit: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sahi2307/flag_mapping.git
cd flag_mapping
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, run:

```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy
```

## üöÄ Usage

In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
streamlit run script.py
```

Then:

1. Upload a **flag image** (formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG)
2. Upload a **pattern image**
3. The application will:

   * Warp the pattern onto the folds of the flag
   * Apply realistic shading and blending
4. View/download the final output directly from the UI
